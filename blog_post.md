# Recommendation Program: A Simple Guide to Finding Your Next Favorite

## Introduction

In today's digital age, the abundance of choices can often feel overwhelming. Whether you're looking for a new restaurant to try, a movie to watch, or a podcast to listen to, the options are endless. This is where our recommendation program comes in. Designed as a simple yet effective tool, it helps users discover new favorites based on their interests.

## Project Overview

The recommendation program is a command-line application built using Python. It allows users to input letters or words related to their interests and provides tailored recommendations across various categories, including:

- Restaurants
- Movies
- Books
- Television
- Podcasts

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Storage**: Store recommendations in a structured format using JSON.
2. **Search Algorithm**: Implement an algorithm to efficiently search and retrieve relevant recommendations based on user input.
3. **Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
4. **Command Line Interface**: Create a user-friendly command line interface for interaction.
5. **Documentation**: Write a comprehensive technical blog post to share insights and experiences from the project.

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure

The recommendations are stored in a JSON file located at `src/data/recommendations.json`. This file contains a categorized list of recommendations, making it easy to access and update.

### Search Algorithm

The core functionality of the program lies in the search algorithm implemented in `src/algorithms/search.py`. This algorithm takes user input and searches through the recommendations dataset to find relevant categories and suggestions.

### User Interaction

The entry point of the program is `src/main.py`, where user input is handled. The program prompts users to enter their interests and displays the corresponding recommendations.

### Utility Functions

To enhance the program's functionality, utility functions are provided in `src/utils/helpers.py`. These functions assist with tasks such as formatting output and validating user input, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Testing

To ensure the reliability of the program, unit tests are written in `tests/test_main.py`. These tests validate the main program logic and confirm that the recommendation functionality works as intended.

## Conclusion

This recommendation program serves as a practical example of how to leverage data structures and algorithms to create a user-friendly application. By following this guide, you can explore the world of recommendations and discover new favorites tailored to your interests.
